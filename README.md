# Emulate_sm
This is a demo showing how to emulate Instagram. Please note that I cannot guarantee stealth mode, but it may work. 


#Step:1
If you want to access someone's Instagram account after obtaining their login credentials or hacking their account, follow these steps:

1. Open your preferred browser.
2. Go to the Instagram website at https://www.instagram.com.
3. Once you are on the login page, access the developer options.  
4. Press Ctrl + Shift + M or click on the toggle device emulation option.

- In default, iPhones or Samsung phones are commonly used. If you have access to your victim's mobile phone information, such as the screen resolution and user string, this step can be done easily..

- If your victim's device is in this list go ahead and proceed login, or else we need to add your custom device. 
- So, in order to do that click on <code>Edit..</code>
- In the emulated devices, click on <code>Add a Custom device</code>

- To know about victim's user string, Head over to this website [Grabify](https://grabify.link/).
- Here's a quick tutorial about **Grabify** [Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lru-UWQ06I0&feature=share&si=ELPmzJkDCLju2KnD5oyZMQ).
- Copy the user string in the Grabify and paste it here and for screen resolution a quick google search will help you. 
- Then add device, and go to back then select this custom device. The go head and try login in to instagram. 

# What this actually do ? 

- Generally, what happens when you log into Instagram on a new device, Instagram will automatically inform the victim there is a login eg. like below

- So, by emulating the victim's device, instagram will send a :warning: alert to the victim like there is a login in this device but the real catch over here is the device we are using, has the same specs as the victim. 
- So, there is a chance the victim can ignore this message. 
- You can ask, but instagram also send the location of the login, but this location was never accurate. 
-  Also, So you're gonna use instagram like that in the victim's device ratio, No idon't!!
-  By simply exiting the responsive page to normal web page or a reload, with that we can use their Instagram. 
-  But still victim will get that Instagram is using in the same phone, even it is using in the Desktop browser.
